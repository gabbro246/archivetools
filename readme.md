# ArchiveTools

ArchiveTools is a suite of user-friendly Python-based tools designed to simplify file management and organization tasks. Whether you need to convert folders to ZIP archives, extract ZIP files back into folders, organize media files by date, or clean up duplicate files, ArchiveTools provides a reliable and efficient solution.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- **Convert Folders to ZIP:** Automatically compresses all folders within a specified directory into ZIP files, ensuring data integrity through hash-based verification.
- **Convert ZIPs to Folders:** Extracts ZIP files to restore the original folder structure, including a verification process to maintain data consistency.
- **Flatten Folder Structure:** Moves all files to a single directory level, with optional renaming to avoid file name conflicts.
- **Organize Media by Date:** Sorts photos and videos into date-based folders using EXIF data or file metadata, with automatic handling of sidecar files (e.g., .xmp, .json, .txt, .srt).
- **Delete Duplicate Files:** Scans a directory for duplicate files (images and videos) and retains only the preferred file based on EXIF or metadata information.

## ðŸ“‚ Usage

### Convert Folders to ZIP with `convertallfoldertozip.py`
Converts all subfolders within a specified directory into ZIP files, ensuring data integrity through file hash verification. Successfully converted folders are deleted to save space.

**Usage:** `python convertallfoldertozip.py --folder [target_folder]`

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the target folder containing folders to convert into ZIP files.

### Convert ZIPs to Folders with `convertallziptofolder.py`
Extracts ZIP files to restore the original folder structure. Includes a verification process that compares file hashes to ensure data consistency. Verified ZIP files are deleted automatically.

**Usage:** `python convertallziptofolder.py --folder [target_folder]`

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: SSpecifies the target folder containing ZIP files to extract.

### Flatten Folder Structure with `flattenfolder.py`
Flattens complex directory structures by moving all files to the top level of a specified folder. Offers optional renaming to handle naming conflicts and allows setting a flattening depth.

**Usage:** `python flattenfolder.py --folder [target_folder] [--rename] [--depth n]`

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the folder to flatten.
- `-r`, `--rename`: Renames files to avoid conflicts.
- `-d`, `--depth`: Sets the depth to flatten. Flattens all levels if not set.

### Organize Media by Date with `organizemediabydate.py`
Organizes media files into folders based on their creation date. Uses EXIF data or file metadata to support organization by day, week, month, or year, and manages related sidecar files automatically.

**Usage:** `python organizemediabydate.py --folder [target_folder] --[day|week|month|year] [--rename]`

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the folder containing media files.
- `-d`, `--day`: Organizes files by individual days.
- `-w`, `--week`: Organizes files by weeks.
- `-m`, `--month`: Organizes files by months.
- `-y`, `--year`: Organizes files by years.
- `--rename`: Renames files if a conflict occurs.

### Delete Duplicate Files with `deleteallduplicate.py`
Scans a directory for duplicate images and videos, retaining only the most relevant file based on EXIF data or metadata (e.g., the oldest photo). Duplicate files are automatically deleted.

**Usage:** `python deleteallduplicate.py --folder [target_folder]`

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the folder to scan for duplicate files.
