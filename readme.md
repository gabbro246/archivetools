```

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the target folder containing ZIP files to extract.

### Flatten Folder Structure with `flattenfolder.py`
Moves all files and folders up one level, with an optional depth argument to iterate through nested folders. Skips files with name conflicts or optionally renames them.

**Usage:**

python flattenfolder.py --folder [target_folder] [--rename] [--depth n]
```

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the folder to flatten.
- `--rename`: Renames files to avoid conflicts.
- `--depth`: Sets the depth to flatten.

### Organize Media by Date with `organizebydate.py`
Sorts media files into date-based folders using EXIF data, file metadata, or sidecar files. Automatically handles sidecar files and offers several date selection modes.

**Usage:**
```bash
python organizebydate.py --folder [target_folder] --[day|week|month|year] [--rename] [--mode mode]
```

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the folder containing media files.
- `-d`, `--day`: Organizes files by individual days.
- `-w`, `--week`: Organizes files by weeks.
- `-m`, `--month`: Organizes files by months.
- `-y`, `--year`: Organizes files by years.
- `--rename`: Renames files instead of skipping.
- `--mode`: Specifies the mode for date selection. Options are:
  - `default`: EXIF > Sidecar > Metadata.
  - `oldest`: Selects the oldest date from any source.
  - `exif`: Only uses EXIF dates.
  - `sidecar`: Only uses sidecar file dates.
  - `metadata`: Only uses file metadata dates.

### Delete Duplicate Files with `deleteallduplicate.py`
Scans a directory for duplicate files and retains only the preferred file based on EXIF or metadata information.

**Usage:**
```bash
python deleteallduplicate.py --folder [target_folder]
```

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the folder to scan for duplicate files.

### Set Files to Selected Date with `setdates.py`
Sets the file creation and modification dates of media files to a selected date based on various modes, including EXIF data, file metadata, sidecar files, or the oldest available date.

**Usage:**
```bash
python setdates.py --folder [target_folder] [--mode mode]
```

**Flags:**
- `-f`, `--folder`: Specifies the target folder to process media files.
- `--mode`: Specifies the mode for date selection. Options are the same as in the `organizebydate.py` script.
