# ArchiveTools

ArchiveTools is a suite of Python-based tools for streamlining file management tasks. It includes utilities for converting folders to ZIP archives (optionally with AES-256 encryption), extracting ZIPs with password handling, organizing media by date, detecting and deleting duplicate files, flattening folder structures, cleaning up junk and empty files/folders, and setting file creation and modification dates using EXIF data, sidecar files, or metadata. The tools are designed to simplify managing large file collections and maintaining organized directories.

## Usage

* For installation see: [Installation](docs/installation.md)
* For more details about flags see: [Flags](docs/flags.md)

### Organize all Media by Date

This script organizes media files in a specified folder into subfolders based on their creation or modification dates. The date used for organization can be sourced from EXIF data, sidecar files, filenames, metadata, or folder names. You can organize files by day, week, month, or year. The script also automatically handles sidecar files. Optionally, early morning times (e.g., up to 03:00) can be treated as belonging to the previous day (`--midnight-shift`).

```bash
python organizebydate.py --folder [target_folder] --[day|week|month|year] [--rename] [--mode mode] [--midnight-shift] [--verbose]
```

### Flatten Folder Structure

This script flattens the folder structure of a specified directory by moving all files from subfolders into the root folder. This operation can be repeated iteratively to a specified depth. Optionally, the script can rename conflicting files instead of skipping them.

```bash
python flattenfolder.py --folder [target_folder] [--rename] [--depth n] [--verbose]
```

### Convert all Folders to ZIPs

This script compresses each folder within a specified directory into an individual ZIP archive. It supports optional AES-256 encryption. After creating each archive, it verifies that all files are included and match the original files' hashes. Upon successful verification, the original folder is automatically deleted.

```bash
python convertfolderstozips.py --folder [target_folder] [--aes256 [password]] [--verbose]
```

If no password is specified with `--aes256`, you will be prompted securely.

### Convert all ZIPs to Folders

This script extracts all ZIP files within a directory into folders. It supports extraction of AES-256 encrypted ZIPs and password handling. After extraction, it verifies that the extracted files match the original content. Upon successful verification, the original ZIP files are automatically deleted.

```bash
python convertzipstofolders.py --folder [target_folder] [--aes256 [password]] [--verbose]
```

If no password is specified with `--aes256`, you will be prompted securely when needed.

### Delete all Duplicate Files

This script scans a specified directory for duplicate media files by comparing their hash values. The preferred file to keep is determined based on a selectable strategy: EXIF data, sidecar files, filenames, metadata, or a heuristic. All detected duplicates are automatically deleted.

```bash
python deleteduplicates.py --folder [target_folder] [--mode mode] [--verbose]
```

### Set Files to Selected Date

This script sets the creation and modification dates of media files and their associated sidecar files to a selected date. The date can be chosen based on EXIF data, ffprobe metadata, sidecar files, filenames, folder names, or file timestamps. It also updates EXIF metadata (for JPEGs) and FFprobe metadata (for MP4/MOV files) where possible.

Supports dry-run mode and force-overwrite mode.

```bash
python setdates.py --folder [target_folder] [--mode mode] [--force] [--dry-run] [--verbose]
```

### Clean up Junk Files and Empty Folders

This script deletes all empty sidecar files, unnecessary junk files (like `.DS_Store`, `desktop.ini`, `Thumbs.db`, `NCFLsDat`, AppleDouble `._*` files, `__MACOSX`, etc.), and all empty folders in the target folder and its subfolders. All extension and name patterns are defined centrally in `_atcore.py`.

```bash
python cleanup.py --folder [target_folder] [--verbose]
```

### Check Media Files for Corruption

This script recursively checks all media files in a folder and its subfolders for corruption. It attempts to open each file (images, videos, and other media formats) and logs whether it could be opened successfully or logs the error message if corruption is detected. Only subdirectories that are completely OK are logged (unless `--verbose` is set, in which case every file is logged). All supported media file extensions are defined centrally in `_atcore.py`.

```bash
python checkmediacorruption.py --folder [target_folder] [--verbose]
```
